EasyDiffraction is a Python library for calculating neutron powder diffraction pattern based on a structural model and refining its parameters against experimental data.

Easydiffraction library is the foundation of the [EasyDiffraction application](https://github.com/EasyScience/EasyDiffractionApp), an intuitive graphical user interface that aims to simplify and speed up the analysis of diffraction experiments.
