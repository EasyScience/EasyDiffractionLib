EasyDiffraction is a Python library for calculating powder diffraction patterns
based on a structural model and refining its parameters against experimental
data.

EasyDiffraction library is the foundation of the [EasyDiffraction application],
an intuitive graphical user interface that aims to simplify and speed up the
analysis of diffraction experiments.

EasyDiffraction library is based on the [EasyScience] framework, which provides the building blocks for creating scientific libraries and applications.
