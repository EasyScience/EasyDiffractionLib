# \_pd_background

This category defines various background functions that could be used when calculating diffractograms. Please see the [IUCr page](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/dictionaries/browse/cif_pd) for further details.

## [\_pd_background.line_segment_X](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/dictionaries/browse/cif_pd)

List of X-coordinates used to create many straight-line segments representing the background in a calculated diffractogram.

Supported values: `2theta` and `time-of-flight`

## [\_pd_background.line_segment_intensity](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/dictionaries/browse/cif_pd)

List of intensities used to create many straight-line segments representing the background in a calculated diffractogram.

## [\_pd_background.X_coordinate](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/dictionaries/browse/cif_pd)

The type of X-coordinate against which the pd_background values were calculated.
