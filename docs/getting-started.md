# Getting started

## Requirements

The EasyDiffraction library is developed in Python, so Python must be installed on your system. The library is compatible with Python versions 3.9 through 3.12.

## Environment setup <small>optional</small> { #environment-setup data-toc-label="Environment setup" }

We recommend using a virtual environment â€“ an isolated Python runtime where any packages you install or update are contained within that environment. If you encounter issues, you can simply delete and recreate the environment. Setting it up is straightforward:

* Create a new virtual environment with:
```console
python3 -m venv venv
```

* Activate the environment with:

    === ":material-apple: macOS"
        ```console
        . venv/bin/activate
        ```
    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"
        ```console
        . venv/Scripts/activate
        ```
    === ":material-linux: Linux"
        ```console
        . venv/bin/activate
        ```

Your terminal should now print `(venv)` before the prompt, which is how you know that you are inside the virtual environment that you just created.

* Exit the environment with:
  ```
  deactivate
  ```

## Installation

### From PyPI <small>recommended</small> { #from-pypi data-toc-label="From PyPI" }

EasyDiffraction is published on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository and can be installed with the package installer for Python (pip), ideally by using a [virtual environment](#environment-setup).

We recommend installing the latest release of EasyDiffraction with the `charts` extras, which include optional dependencies used for simplified visualization of charts and tables. This can be especially useful for running the Jupyter Notebook examples. To do so, use the following command:
```console
pip install 'easydiffraction[charts]'
```

If only the core functionality is needed, the library can be installed simply with:
```console
pip install easydiffraction
```

To install a specific version of EasyDiffraction, e.g. 0.1.3, use:
```console
pip install 'easydiffraction==0.1.3'
```

Upgrading to the latest version can be done with:
```console
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall easydiffraction
```

To show the currently installed version, use:
```console
pip show easydiffraction
```

### From GitHub

Installing an unreleased version is not recommended and should only be done for testing purposes. 

Here is an example of how to install EasyDiffraction directly from our GitHub repository, e.g., from the `develop` branch:
```console
pip install git+https://github.com/EasyScience/EasyDiffractionLib@develop
```

To do the same with extra dependencies, use:
```console
pip install 'easydiffraction[charts] @ git+https://github.com/EasyScience/EasyDiffractionLib@develop'
```

## Examples

We have a collection of Jupyter Notebook examples that demonstrate how to use EasyDiffraction for various tasks. These examples are presented in the [How to use](how-to-use/index.md#how-to-use) section of the documentation as static HTML pages.

You can also run these Jupyter Notebook examples yourself either locally or in Google Colab. 

These Jupyter Notebook examples can be downloaded either one by one from the [How to use](how-to-use/index.md#how-to-use) section or all together as a zip archive from the [EasyDiffraction releases](https://github.com/EasyScience/EasyDiffractionLib/releases/latest).

### Run locally

To run the examples locally, you need to install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Here are the steps to take in the case of Jupyter Notebook:

* Install Jupyter Notebook:
  ```console
  pip install notebook
  ```
* Download EasyDiffraction examples from GitHub for the latest release, e.g., using curl:
  ```console
  curl --location --remote-name https://github.com/EasyScience/EasyDiffractionLib/releases/latest/download/examples.zip
  ```
* Unzip the downloaded archive:
  ```console
  unzip examples.zip
  ```
* Run Jupyter Notebook server in the `examples/` directory:
  ```console
  jupyter notebook examples/
  ```
* Open your web browser and go to:
  ```console
  http://localhost:8888/
  ```
* Select one of the `*.ipynb` files.

### Via Google Colab

!!! note

    To run the examples in Google Colab, you need to have a Google account.

Google Colab is a free cloud service that allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks online, enabling you to run the examples without installing anything on your local machine.

In the top right corner of each example, under the [How to use](how-to-use/index.md#how-to-use) section, you will find a button to open that example in Google Colab :google-colab:
