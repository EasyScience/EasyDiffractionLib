# Model

EasyDiffraction allow you to load the crystallographic model in CIF format. The
model is then used to calculate the diffraction pattern, which is compared to
the experimental data. The model parameters can be refined to improve the
agreement between the calculated and measured data.

An example of the CIF-based model has been given in the
[Project structure](project-structure.md) section.
