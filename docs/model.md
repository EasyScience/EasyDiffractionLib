# Model

EasyDiffraction allow you to load the crystallographic model in CIF format. The model is then used to calculate the diffraction pattern, which is compared to the experimental data. The model parameters can be refined to improve the agreement between the calculated and measured data. 

An example of the CIF-based model has been given in the [Project structure](project-structure.md) section.
